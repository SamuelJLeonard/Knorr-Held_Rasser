This repository contains R code for implementing a Monte Carlo Markov Chain described in "Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps" by Knorr-Held and Rasser (Biometrics 2000).  Their paper is a Bayesian, nonparametric algorithm for detecting spatial clusters of elevated disease risk.  

Each folder contains a function and a quick description of what the function does.
