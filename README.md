#### R code to implement the MCMC described in Knorr-Held and Rasser (2000)

This repository contains R code I wrote during the summer of 2017 for implementing the MCMC described in Knorr-Held and Rasser's 2000 paper "Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps".

Here's an incredibly brief summary of their paper:

The incidence of a particular non-communicable disease may be influenced by spatial risk factors.  If this is the case, adjacent regions within a given country that experience high exposure to such spatial risk factors would share a high incidence of this disease.  These adjacent regions form a cluster of high disease incidence.  Similarly, areas at low risk will form clusters of low disease incidence.  In their 2000 paper "Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps" Knorr-Held and Rasser develop a Bayesian nonparametric algorithm for the detection of such disease clusters, and apply it to a data on oral cancer rates in Germany in the late 1980s.
