This repository contains R code I wrote for implementing the disease cluster detection algorithm described "Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps" by Knorr-Held and Rasser (Biometrics 2000).  Their paper is a Bayesian, nonparametric algorithm for detecting spatial clusters of elevated disease risk.  

You will need to download three files to run the algorithm yourself: 'Knorr Held MCMC.R', 'Knorr Held Functions and Data.R', and 'district_distances.txt' 

Once you have these files on your hard drive, open 'Knorr Held MCMC.R' for specific instructions.

'Knorr-Held Rasser Model Implementation.pdf' is a summary of my implementation of the Knorr-Held and Rasser algorithm.  There you'll find plots of the results of my implementation, along with a brief summary of how the model works.
