This repository contains R code I wrote for implementing the disease cluster detection algorithm described "Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps" by Knorr-Held and Rasser (Biometrics 2000).  Their paper is a Bayesian, nonparametric algorithm for detecting spatial clusters of elevated disease risk.  

To run the MCMC yourself, download the two R files 'Knorr Held MCMC.R' and 'Knorr Held Functions and Data.R'.  Then open the file 'Knorr Held MCMC.R'.

'Knorr-Held Rasser Model Implementation.pdf' is a summary of my implementation of the Knorr-Held and Rasser algorithm.  There you'll find plots of the results of my implementation, along with a brief summary of how the model works.
